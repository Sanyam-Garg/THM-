Calculate md5sum of encrypted note1

Decrypt note1 using passphrase given in the hint. (GPG)

Decrypt note2 using openssl





GPG uses symmetric encryption, hence we don't need the private key, just the passphrase provided in the hint.

Note2 was encrypted using asymmetric encryption, so our own private key was needed, along with the passphrase for it.
